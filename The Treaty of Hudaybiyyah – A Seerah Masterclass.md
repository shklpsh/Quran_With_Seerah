# 🕊️ The Treaty of Hudaybiyyah – A Seerah Masterclass

## 🌿 Prelude: The Dream That Sparked a Journey

In 6 AH, the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ saw a dream: he and his companions were entering Mecca peacefully, performing tawaf around the Ka‘bah. Dreams of prophets are revelation, so he announced:

> “Let us go to Mecca for Umrah.”

He set out with **1,400 companions**, dressed in ihram, carrying sacrificial animals, and bearing no weapons except for travel gear. This was a peaceful pilgrimage, not a military campaign.

### Key Companions Present:
- Abu Bakr as-Siddiq
- Umar ibn al-Khattab
- Ali ibn Abi Talib
- Uthman ibn Affan
- Abdur-Rahman ibn Awf
- Bilal ibn Rabah
- Salman al-Farsi
- Suhaib ar-Rumi
- Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl (later involved dramatically)

The Prophet ﷺ took **Umm Salamah** as his wife on this journey.

## 🐪 The Halt at Hudaybiyyah

As they neared Mecca, the Prophet’s camel **Al-Qaswa** suddenly knelt and refused to move. He said:

> “She has not stopped out of stubbornness. The One who stopped the elephant has stopped her.”

They camped at **Hudaybiyyah**, just outside the sacred boundary. Quraysh, alarmed, sent envoys to negotiate.

## 🕊️ Negotiations Begin

### 1. Urwah ibn Mas‘ud al-Thaqafi
He came first to assess the Muslims. He returned impressed, saying:

> “I have seen kings, but never have I seen a people love their leader as Muhammad’s companions love him.”

### 2. Uthman ibn Affan
Sent as an envoy to Quraysh. Rumors of his death led to the pledge of loyalty:

### 🌳 Bay’at al-Ridwan
The Prophet ﷺ took a pledge under a tree:

> “We will not flee. We will fight if needed.”

Allah honored this in the Qur’an:

> _“Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you under the tree…”_ (Surah Al-Fath 48:18)

## 📜 The Treaty Is Drafted

Quraysh sent **Suhayl ibn Amr** to finalize terms. The Prophet ﷺ instructed **Ali ibn Abi Talib** to write the treaty.

### Key Terms:
1. Muslims would return to Medina without performing Umrah that year.
2. They could return the following year for three days.
3. A 10-year truce was established.
4. Tribes were free to ally with either side.
5. Any Qurayshi who fled to Medina would be returned; Muslims fleeing to Mecca would not be returned.

## 💔 The Abu Jandal Incident

As the treaty was being signed, **Abu Jandal**, son of Suhayl ibn Amr, escaped Meccan captivity and reached the Muslim camp, shackled and wounded.

He cried:

> “O Muslims! Will you return me to the oppressors?”

Suhayl demanded his return. The Prophet ﷺ, though deeply moved, honored the treaty:

> “Be patient, O Abu Jandal. Allah will make a way for you and others like you.”

**Umar ibn al-Khattab** was distraught, questioning the treaty’s fairness. The Prophet ﷺ replied:

> “I am the servant of Allah, and I will not disobey Him.”

## 🌟 Divine Revelation: Victory Declared

As Muslims returned to Medina, Allah revealed:

> _“Indeed, We have given you a clear victory…”_ (Surah Al-Fath 48:1)

### Outcome:
- Quraysh violated the treaty.
- The Prophet ﷺ entered Mecca peacefully with 10,000 companions.
- **Fath Makkah** became the ultimate vindication of Hudaybiyyah.
